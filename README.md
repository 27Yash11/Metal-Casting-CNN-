# Metal-Casting-CNN

In this project, we developed a deep learning model for metal casting image classification. We gathered and preprocessed the data, divided it into training and testing sets, selected an appropriate deep learning model, and trained and evaluated the model on the testing set. We also fine-tuned the model to achieve better performance and tested it on new data.

Our results show that the model can accurately classify different types of metal casting images, which can have practical applications in the manufacturing industry. By automating the classification of metal casting images, the model can save time and resources and improve the quality control of manufacturing processes.

Overall, this project demonstrates the importance of deep learning in image classification tasks and highlights the potential of metal casting image classification for the manufacturing industry. Future work can involve incorporating additional features such as image segmentation and object detection to further improve the accuracy of the model.
